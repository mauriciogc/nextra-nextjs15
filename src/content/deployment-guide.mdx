# Deployment Guide

This site can be deployed easily on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), or any static host.

## Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and import your repository.
3. Set the build command:

```bash
npm run build
```

And the output directory:

```bash
.next
```

4. Done!!

## Netlify

Use a custom output adapter or export to static HTML using `next export`. (Not ideal for Nextra, which prefers SSR.)

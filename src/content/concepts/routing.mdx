# Routing with App Router

Next.js App Router introduces a new file-based routing system using nested layouts and server components.

In this setup:

- Dynamic routes like `[[...mdxPath]]` allow Nextra to automatically map any `.mdx` file into a live route.
- `generateStaticParamsFor()` and `importPage()` are used to render these routes at build time.
- The folder `/src/content/` becomes the source of your content tree.

```tsx
export const generateStaticParams = generateStaticParamsFor('mdxPath');
```

> [!TIP]
>
> You don't need to define every route manually â€” it's fully automated.

# Project Structure

This page explains the organization of the codebase and where to place your content.

```bash
.
├── src/
│   ├── content/         # MDX pages
│   ├── app/             # App Router (layout.tsx, page.tsx, etc.)
│   ├── components/      # Reusable UI components
│   └── mdx-components.ts
